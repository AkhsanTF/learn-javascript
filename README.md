# Learn JavaScript 🚀

Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey!  
This repository documents my progress as I explore and practice core JavaScript concepts through real-world mini projects and experiments.

- JavaScript syntax and logic
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Functions, arrays, and objects
- API integration and fetch
- Debugging and browser dev tools
